# Discrete-Group8
So we chose the topic sudoku solver, and on the first day of our discussion, we discussed on how sudoku works really. We discusses the aspects of the game, how it is played, what things to look for and eventually played it for a good 40 minutes to ensure we are familiarized with our topic really well
the next task was to learn about recursion and its properties, its relation to sudoku and how it is involved in the game. we got know about the base and recursive cases, stack memory and divide and conquer approach. We larnt about recursion quite briefly in programming fundamentals and this research further developed our concepts.
